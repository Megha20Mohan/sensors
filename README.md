# *FIRE ALARM SYSTEM*
Fire Alarm System is a simple circuit that detects the fire and activates the Siren 
Sound or Buzzer. It has a number of devices working together to detect and warn 
people through visual and audio appliances when smoke, fire, carbon monoxide 
or other emergencies are present. Fire Alarm Circuits, Temperature Sensors and 
Smoke Sensors are a part of the security systems which help in detecting or 
preventing damage.
In this mini project we are mainly focusing on the sensors such as temperature 
and gas sensors that we use and interface it with Arduino using TinkerCad and 
LTspice.
Installing Fire Alarm Systems in commercial buildings like offices, movie 
theatres, shopping malls and other public places is compulsory. These alarms may 
be activated automatically from smoke detectors and heat detectors or may also 
be activated via manual fire alarm activation devices such as manual call points 
or pull stations. This is a very simple alarm circuit using Arduino Uno, Piezo, Gas 
sensor, Temperature sensor, resistors, LED, wire and breadboard. The primary 
purpose of fire alarm system is to provide an early warning of fire so that people 
can be evacuated & immediate action can be taken to stop or eliminate of the fire 
effect as soon as possible.
